# Bioinformatics Portfolio

This repository serves as a showcase for the bioinformatics applications and pipelines I have developed. It demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and creating interactive tools for biological research.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Drug Sensitivity and Gene Expression Analysis for Senhwa Biosciences

A Shiny app for exploring relationships between drug sensitivity and gene expression/copy number across various cancer types. For more details, see the [Senhwa Biosciences project README](apps/shiny/senhwa/README.md).

### 2. Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis Pipeline

A comprehensive pipeline for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, implemented in both R and Python. For more details, see the [scRNA-seq Analysis Pipeline README](scripts/scRNA_analysis/README.md).

These projects showcase my ability to create user-friendly, interactive tools for complex biological data analysis, combining statistical methods with intuitive visualizations to aid in scientific research and drug discovery.
